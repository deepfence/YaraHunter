# YaraHunter

Deepfence YaraHunter scans container images, running Docker containers, and filesystems to find indicators of malware. It uses a [YARA ruleset](https://github.com/deepfence/yara-rules) to identify resources that match known malware signatures, and may indicate that the container or filesystem has been compromised.

YaraHunter can be used in the following ways:

- **At build-and-test**: scan build artifacts in the CI/CD pipeline, reporting on possible indicators of malware
- **At rest**: scan local container images, for example, before they are deployed, to verify they do not contain malware
- **At runtime**: scan running docker containers, for example, if you observe unusual network traffic or CPU activity
- **Against filesystems**: at any time, YaraHunter can scan a local filesystems for indicators of compromise

Key capabilities:

- Scan running and at-rest containers; scan filesystems; scan during CI/CD build operations
- Run anywhere: highly-portable, docker container form factor
- Designed for automation: easy-to-deploy, easy-to-parse JSON output

YaraHunter is a work-in-progress (check the [Roadmap](https://github.com/deepfence/YaraHunter/projects) and [issues list](issues)), and will be integrated into the [ThreatMapper](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper) threat discovery platform. We welcome any contributions to help to improve this tool.

## Quick Start

For full instructions, refer to the [YaraHunter Documentation](https://docs.deepfence.io/docs/yarahunter/).

## Example: Finding Indicators of Compromise in a container image

Images may be compromised with the installation of a cryptominer such as XMRig. In the following example, we'll scan a legitimiate cryptominer image that contains the same xmrig software that is often installed through an exploit:

Pull the official **yarahunter** image:

```
docker pull deepfenceio/yara-hunter:latest
```

or Build it from source clone this repo and run below command
```
make docker
```

Pull the image that needs to be scanned for example `metal3d/xmrig` and scan it:

```
docker pull metal3d/xmrig

docker run -i --rm --name=deepfence-yarahunter \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     -v /tmp:/home/deepfence/output \
     deepfenceio/yara-hunter:latest --image-name metal3d/xmrig:latest --output=json > xmrig-scan.json
```

This returns, among other things, clear indication of the presence of XMRig. Note that we store the output (`xmrig-scan.json`) for quick and easy manipulation:

```
# Extract the IOC array values.  From these, extract the values of the 'Matched Rule Name' key
cat /tmp/xmrig-scan.json | jq '.IOC[] | ."Matched Rule Name"'
```

This returns a list of the IOCs identified in the container we scanned.

To get table formatted output omit `--output=json` flag
